# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Airbnb clone project! This project is a web development exercise where I aimed to replicate the look and feel of the Airbnb website using HTML and CSS.

## Files

1. *index.html:* This file serves as the main structure of the website. It includes sections like headers, navigation, and content, mirroring the structure of the Airbnb site.

2. *index.css:* In this file, you'll find all the styling details for the project. From color schemes to layout configurations, this is where the visual magic happens.

3. *images folder:* Contains all the images used in the project. Each image is carefully selected to enhance the overall visual appeal and resemblance to the Airbnb website.

## How to View

To view the Airbnb clone, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. You can also deploy it to a live server for a more interactive experience.

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback. Happy coding! ðŸš€
